                There are approximately 300,000 stray dogs in the city of Bangalore, and you can bet anything that The Voice of Stray Dogs is here for every single one of them. <br><br>

Unlike other organizations, VOSD does things a little differently -  our rescued dogs receive quality medical care from private veterinary clinics, on par with that received by most pets, if not better. Over the last three-and-a-half years or so, we've spent about approximately Rs. 7 crores (US$1.2) to develop unsurpassed infrastructure, technology, and care for our dogs. This includes everything from our Android app for rescue reporting, software to track the status of any reported dog, medical expenditure, and the cost of running the ever-expanding VOSD Sanctuary.<br><br>

We've done a lot, but we aren't even close to done. Our plans aren't for five or ten years later, they're for <i style = "font-family: Gotham Medium;">now</i>. Join hands with us as we leave no stone unturned in pioneering healthcare for strays and turn thought into immediate action.<br><br>

Every rupee is accounted for, as VOSD follows a 100% Transparency Policy. All contributions receive an invoice, and are updated on a daily basis and can be found <a href = " https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lrhwMpS-FuQsX7nBDZBs6E4O2RzyU2Bh0fHVh807N6A/edit#gid=0"><b style = "font-family: Gotham Medium;">here</b></a>. <br><br>
