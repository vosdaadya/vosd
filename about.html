                Established in 2012, the Voice of Stray Dogs (VOSD) was founded by Rakesh Shukla to put an end to the unjust treatment of animals in today's society. Although India is one of the few cultures in the world that has always propagated the idea of compassion towards all living beings, man, in the race for "development", increasingly sees animals as mere means to an end. This has led to the prevalent mentality of animals considered as resources, free for mankind to abuse and exploit as seen fit.<br><br>

VOSD, thus, was established as a call to action in an age where animals are denied their very basic rights, despite living harmoniously alongside man for centuries. With immediate response, continual updates, and expert care, VOSD's motto is to never give up on man's best friend.
