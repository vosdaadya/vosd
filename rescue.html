                VOSD is the proud orchestrator of the world's largest citywide rescue for dogs. Any dog in distress can be reported via the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/strays.in/app/410312912374011/"><b style = "font-family: Gotham Medium;">Rescue or Donate</b></a> tab on our official <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/strays.in"><b style = "font-family: Gotham Medium;">Facebook</b></a> page. You will receive updates about the condition of every dog you report for rescue, along with photographs and descriptions via VOSD Live Updates to your email ID, as well as SMS updates to your registered mobile number.<br><br>

From rescue to rehabilitation, each and every dog is offered 360  care. Regardless of breed, size, age, or injury, every reported dog is taken only to the city's most well-known private veterinarians to ensure quality treatment, no matter the cost. <br><br>

We are sucessfully rescuing and treating over 5000 dogs since 2012 - even those with chronic conditions -  whom we were told had "no chance of survival". We take no shortcuts in saving lives. <br><br>
